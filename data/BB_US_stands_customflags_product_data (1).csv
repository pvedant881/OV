Bamboo X Banner Stands Are a Natural.</h2> <p>The natural warmth and beauty of bamboo will showcase your banner display stand in upscale style. And the inherent strength of bamboo combined with the X design of the stand, will hold your banner securely. In addition, bamboo is a renewable resource. It grows back amazingly fast and it's a grass. So you can feel good about not destroying any trees.</p> <h2>An X-cellent choice for flexibility and economy</h2> <p>Bamboo X banner stands are designed to support larger banners. Simply fasten each corner of the banner to the rods that form the stand and your message will be anchored in place. Banners are printed on processed cloth material (plastic satin). They can be taken down easily and interchanged with other banners, allowing you to get many years of use out of the stand.</p> <p>The bamboo X banner stands are lighter weight and cost less than the bamboo roll-up stands, but they are not as easy to transport. These types of banner display stands are ideal for indoor events, malls, retail promotions, directing people to seminars in hotels, highlighting specials in restaurants, and reinforcing points in business meetings.</p> <p>If a bamboo X banner stand is what you need, give us a call.

To do this, highly interactive advertising tools, such as flags, are beneficial. With distinctive images and unique patterns, the <strong>triangle flags</strong> by BannerBuzz provide appealing designs that help you communicate information. For maximum exposure, hang them on your storefront or inside.</p> <p>The promotional flags are designed with fresh logos and imagery because of the 1440 DPI, Full color, dye sublimation printing. Their full-color prints produce vivid graphics that grab attention quickly. The dye-sublimation method results in smooth color variations that are pleasing to the eye. To meet your visibility requirements, you may print on one or both sides of the flags. For optimum interactivity, use 2 distinct pictures or the same image when printing on both sides.</p> <p>Our custom triangle flags come in 2 printing options that include single- and double-sided printing options. The standard single-sided printing option prints on one side using high-quality printing technology and inks. In double-sided printing, you have the option to get your design printed on both sides. You can get the same or different image printed on both sides. These flags have a liner sewn in between the two sides.</p> <p>These custom flags use a heavy-duty cloth, which gives them a long lifespan. Their 90GSM fabric is more abrasion-resistant, lowering replacement costs and the total cost of ownership. For a long print life and excellent engagement, the flags use fade-free UV ink. We also offer a wide array of Sports flags that can be used for advertisement and promotion of all kinds of sports.</p> <p>Metal grommets are in place on the fabric flags on one side. These grommets make the flags simple to mount onto poles. The grommets prevent holes from being misshapen or ripping. The sturdy metal holes also allow hanging ropes, hooks, or other devices to pass through securely.</p> <p>Our flag is customizable by using the online design tool to match your company's design requirements. To make ordering simple, choose from a selection of pre-made design templates. Alternatively, upload any authentic artwork to give the fabric flags a sense of identity. Our Marketing flags and Marketing flags help your customer to know more about the product, service, brand, or company being advertised.</p> <p>As part of routine maintenance, the custom flags use synthetic textiles that are machine or hand-washable. To allow for reuse, their stiff knitting withstands normal or mild detergents and many wash cycles.</p> <p>To make your personalized triangle flags noticeable enough to draw people’s attention, you need to hang them properly. Drooping flags tend to wear out easily and fail to generate expected business. To surge you through these issues, we offer multiple hanging options including from metal grommets to pole pockets. You can even customize the position of pole pockets as per your choice.</p> <p>Purchase the best triangle flags online from BannerBuzz to get bulk discount that will help your organization save money.

Our advertising flags get the job done and communicate your desired message clearly to passersby. The <strong>custom pinpoint flags</strong> are ideal for retail stores, restaurants, fitness studios, and special events, as well as for announcements or updates.</p> <p>We make our pinpoint flags from knitted polyester fabric with a graphic weight of 90 GSM for outstanding durability. The hardware frame is made up of composite fiberglass material for resilient performance. The flags hold up well against environmental impact, are tightly woven, and won't snag easily. They have a long service life due to their excellent make and material.</p> <p>We use full color 1440 DPI, dye sublimation printing process to make our indoor flags vivid for effective and clear communication. With high-resolution images that have distinct colors, the flags are easily visible to passersby. The pinpoint flags printing incorporates a unique style and fade-resistant graphics that sets it apart from the rest of your marketing tools.</p> <p>When ordering our business flags, you can choose from different options when it comes to hardware, the type of base, and whether to add a graphic image. We offer four types of base options with our personalized pinpoint flags-spike base, square base, cross base, and cross base with water bag.

This will allow you to upload an image or use our simple design tool to create a unique pattern on the flag. Both the options for editing the flag are available free of cost. Use them to popularize your marketing ideas and creations.</p> <p>The flag comes with options for single-side and double-side printing. You can have single-side graphics printed on the flag with 50% to 60% mirrored images at the back or double-sided graphics with the same image or two separate images. A liner would be sewn in between the flags for clarity of graphics. Double-sided printing ensures multi-dimensional advertising.

Ideal for your brand promotions at these events, our hard-to-miss <strong>Concave Flags</strong> from BannerBuzz are a perfect way to catch the attention of passersby, bring in customers, and to increase sales.</p> <p>Out of all the marketing tools available, custom concave flags are perhaps the easiest to put up and put down at a short notice. No more running around looking for a ladder and cable ties to set up these flags. With a concave flag, all you need is to set up the stands and add the flag, easy. This leaves you more time to focus on the important part, attracting your customers.</p> <p>Available in sizes that range from 6 ft to 14 ft, our concave flags are easy to set up. Created out of flag fabric material, the weight of the flags is not more than 90 GSM. This makes them not just lightweight but also UV-and-fade resistant.</p> <p>Adding to the strength of the concave flag is the hardware material made of carbon composite fiberglass that is known for its toughness and durability. Helping them stay up strong are the two base options on offer. While the cross base is ideal for use on hard surface ground, the spike base is perfect for use outdoors. In the case of the latter, simply attach the flag to the base and pin it into the ground. The finishing includes a black pole pocket on the left side.</p> <p>If opting only for the hardware, keep in mind that it includes poles and base only. The graphics-only option does not include poles and base, while the graphics-with-hardware one includes poles and base too.</p> <p>The concave flags can be easily hand-washed with a mild liquid detergent - the kind used for delicate items. To wash them in the machine, just set it on the gentle cycle with warm water and add a mild liquid laundry detergent to it. However, we must add that frequent use of the washing machine to clean the flag may harm the knitting of its fabric.</p> <p>The personalized concave flags come with two printing options. The single-sided printed flags show the image on the reverse side as a mirrored image with 50-60% visibility. The double-sided concave flags printing can have two separate images or the same image used on both sides. These flags have a liner sewn in between the two sides. To personalize your flags, choose any of the templates created by our team of designers. You can also create a design of your own complete with taglines, themes, and colors that reflect what your brand is all about.</p> <p>For those looking to order in bulk, special discounts are on offer. Shop online for your concave flags and get your special discount. Buy more to grab bigger discounts and save on your company budget. If looking for faster delivery, just choose ‘priority’ shipping before you check out.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <!-- end of accessories section --> <!-- end of container -->","<style> .th150 { text-align: left; width: 200px; padding-right: 30px; vertical-align: top; } .productDetails { width: 100%; } </style> <div class=""newSpecificationBox""> <div class=""productDetails""> <table class=""productDetailsSection""> <tbody> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> Graphic Material </th> <td> Knitted Polyester Fabric </td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> Graphic Weight </th> <td> 2.6 oz </td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> Print Type </th> <td> 1440 DPI, Full Color, Dye Sublimation Printing </td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> Printing </th> <td> Single-side: Flag will show the image on the back side as a mirrored image with 50-60% visibility. </td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> Hardware Material </th> <td> Carbon Composite Fiber Glass </td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> Pole Diameter </th> <td> Top: 0.16"" </td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> Hanging Option </th> <td> Black pole pocket at left side </td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> Base Option </th> <td> Spike Base/ Cross Base </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> <div class=""newSpecificationBox""> <div class=""productDetails""> <h3> Spike Base </h3> <table class=""productDetailsSection""> <tbody> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> Leg Length </th> <td> 20"" </td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> Diameter </th> <td> Base: 0.53"" </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> <div class=""newSpecificationBox""> <div class=""productDetails""> <h3> Cross Base </h3> <table class=""productDetailsSection""> <tbody> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> Leg Length </th> <td> 14.5"" (4 nos) </td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> Ground Clearance </th> <td> 2.16"" </td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> Diameter </th> <td> Base: 0.53"" </td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> Flag Size (W x H) </th> <td> Pole Length </td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> 1.75"" x 6.25"" </th> <td> 8.86' (3 poles) </td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> 2.08"" x 8.58"" </th> <td> 11.48' (4 poles) </td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;""> 2.67"" x 11.17"" </th> <td> 9.84' (4 poles) </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> <h3> Graphic Care Instructions </h3> <ul> <li> Polyester, nylon or other synthetic fabrics are normally safe to wash in a machine </li> <li> Add mild detergent to warm water and use the gentle cycle on your washing machine </li> <li> You can also hand wash the flag with a mild liquid detergent made for delicate items </li> <li> Frequent use of washing machine for cleaning flag may harm knitting of the fabric </li> </ul>","<div class=""full-width-container""> <div class=""container""> <div class=""new-content""> <div class=""features-section""> <h3> Key Features </h3> <ul> <li> <b> Eye-catching: </b> Ideal for trade shows, events, and festivals designed to make your brand pop </li> <li> <b> Durable and Vibrant: </b> Crafted from high-quality 2.6 oz knitted polyester, built to resist UV and fading </li> <li> <b> Stable Construction: </b> Sturdy carbon composite fiberglass poles for enhanced stability and longevity </li> <li> <b> Fully Customizable: </b> Design online, upload artwork, or work with our designers for a unique piece </li> <li> <b> Easy Setup and Maintenance: </b> Tool-free setup with various base options and simple cleaning </li> <li> <b> Optimal Visibility: </b> Choose from single-sided or double-sided flags with enhanced liner for clear designs </li> </ul> </div> <div class=""description-section""> <h3> Product Overview </h3> <h3> Your Brand Deserves to Be Seen: Showcase It with Our Premium Concave Flags </h3> <p> Capture the spotlight at any event with our premium custom concave flags.

You can wash in a machine on the gentle cycle with warm water or hand wash the flag with a mild detergent.

Flags offer high visibility and various designs are available to match unique themes, occasions, and business demands. Quality <strong>custom garden flags</strong> are ideal for decoration and are suitable for improving brand recognition.</p> <p>Made of 90 GSM knitted polyester fabric with an iron pole as hardware, these flags are sturdy and durable. Their weather-resistant materials can withstand exposure to environmental elements to support outdoor installation. The durability of the flag usually depends on whether it has been installed indoors or outdoors. If climatic elements are erratic, the flag’s durability may not be as long as when the climate is stable.</p> <p>The garden flag printing is done using the sublimation printing technique. These flags have vibrant backgrounds and eye-catching graphics that capture the attention of passers-by with ease. Printed on soft knitted fabric, these fade-resistant signs make aesthetic additions to your outdoor spaces.</p> <p>We offer an online design tool that allows you to create personalized garden flags as per your requirements. Choose between single or double-sided prints for optimal visibility. Double-sided flags also enable you to simultaneously display two different messages. You can also upload custom artwork with a company logo or tagline to improve brand awareness.</p> <p>You also have the option to hire a designer for creating your graphics precisely as you want. This feature is available at an added cost. Get your logo or graphics designed professionally by our expert in the shade you want. For color consistency, you can use our Pantone Color Match System and input the color code that you want us to use.</p> <p>The flags come with an option for getting the graphics printed on a single-side or double side. For single-side printing, the graphics will have a mirrored visibility of 50% to 60% on the backside. For the double-sided printing option, the same image could be used on both sides or different images could be used. A liner would be sewn in between for enhanced visibility.</p> <p>Installation components like iron poles mean our decorative garden flags are easy to set up. Slide the provided pole into the fabric, then mount the flag into the ground in moments. Simple steps for installation eliminate the need for an extra hand, making the entire process straightforward.</p> <p>Manufactured from lightweight components, these flags allow easy portability. Their dimensions ensure they take up little space during storage. Since they are reusable for multiple events, the yard flags help decrease your overall spending.</p> <p>Our low-maintenance flags come with easy cleaning requirements to save you time. Simply wipe them off with a dry cloth to prevent dust and debris build-up or hand-wash using cold water and a mild liquid detergent. You can also machine wash the flag setting it on a gentle cycle using warm water. To maintain graphic colors and material integrity, avoid washing the fabric in the machine frequently. Buy these flags to fulfill your advertising goals easily. Quick and easy to port, you can place them at strategic locations for a wide audience coverage.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <!-- end of accessories section --> <!-- end of container -->","<style> .th150 { text-align: left; width: 200px; padding-right: 30px; vertical-align: top; } .productDetails { width: 100%; } </style> <div class=""newSpecificationBox""> <div class=""productDetails""> <table class=""productDetailsSection""> <tbody> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;"">Graphic Material</th> <td>Knitted Polyester Fabric</td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;"">Graphic Weight</th> <td>2.6 oz</td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;"">Print Type</th> <td>1440 DPI, Full Color, Dye Sublimation Printing</td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;"">Printing</th> <td>Single-side: Flag will show the image on the back side as a mirrored image with 50-60% visibility.</td> </tr> <tr> <th class=""th150"" style=""text-align: left;"">Hardware Material</th> <td>Iron Pole</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> <h3>Graphic Care Instructions</h3> <ul> <li>Polyester, nylon or other synthetic fabrics are normally safe to wash in a machine</li> <li>Add mild detergent to warm water and use the gentle cycle on your washing machine</li> <li>You can also hand wash the flag with a mild liquid detergent made for delicate items</li> <li>Frequent use of washing machine for cleaning flag may harm knitting of the fabric</li> </ul>","<div class=""full-width-container""> <div class=""container""> <div class=""new-content""> <div class=""features-section""> <h3>Key Features</h3> <ul> <li><strong> Versatile Use: </strong> Ideal for special events, festivals, or decorating home and business environments</li> <li><strong> Robust Construction: </strong> Made from 2.6 oz knitted polyester and sturdy iron poles, built for all-season durability</li> <li><strong> Precision Printing: </strong> Features sharp, vivid graphics using sublimation printing that resists fading</li> <li><strong> Printing Choices: </strong> Choose single-sided for a mirrored back or double-sided for unique images on each side</li> <li><strong> Design Flexibility: </strong> Upload artwork, use online design tool, or hire a designer for custom creations</li> <li><strong> Easy Install and Upkeep: </strong> Quick slide-and-mount system for easy installation and minimal maintenance</li> </ul> </div> <div class=""description-section""> <h3>Product Overview</h3> <h3>Make a Statement at Your Next Outdoor Event with Our Custom Garden Flags</h3> <p>Boost your outdoor event's visibility and add vibrant flair with our premium custom garden flags.

They are not easily damaged, and the ink lasts for an extended period of time. For clip flags-teardrop printing, we employ sublimation technique. A design is first printed onto unique paper. When heated, the inks are converted to gases, which combine with the cloth to imprint the fabric permanently. Since the ink is entrenched in the fabric or substrate rather than merely sitting on top like a typical print, the effects are long-lasting and less prone to fading. The procedure is very similar to getting a tattoo. The heat causes the fabric's pores to open, and as pressure is applied, the ink cools and solidifies once more.</p> <p>Sublimation printing embeds the ink in the fabric's fibers, making the flags resistant to fading. The flags draw people to your establishment with the high-resolution imagery and details. The final graphics are eye-catching, vibrant and glossy.</p> <p>With our custom clip flags, we include all of the necessary hardware. They are available with a pole and a clip attached to them. The pole is pivoted to allow the flag to be rotated easily. It helps in reducing the wear and tear on the flag.</p> <p>We offer great bulk discounts on our custom flags. If you wish to buy our modular display in multiple quantities, ranging from 2 to 100, then you’re in the right place. Place an order now for our custom flags in bulk, with your preferred marketing message to get awesome discounts.

Crowds at events you support like to cheer and actively show their loyalty to sports teams, and BannerBuzz caters to these needs with attention-grabbing <strong>hand flags.</strong> Hand out the flags at your store openings or to promote an upcoming special occasion so your potential customers will identify your company with your brand logo on the flags.</p> <p>Expert craftsmanship and 90 GSM knitted flag fabric result in premium-quality hand flags. With good durability, the flags handle the wear and tear during outdoor events. Display the support of your business for a local sports team or community event with durable flag graphics that stay visible even after repeated use.</p> <p>For high-quality hand flag printing, we use a dye-sublimation printing process to produce high-quality, vibrant, and high-resolution images for handheld flags. Vivid graphics deliver smooth and subtle color variations. Our single flags display the mirrored image on the back with 50-60% visibility.</p> <p>With our customization options, your business can choose from a wide range of available sizes. Custom hand flags can be printed as per individual requirements. We provide you with multiple options such as uploading artwork, designing online, or hiring a designer to boost your brand's marketing performance.

If conditions are extreme, the flags are lightweight and easy to put into storage so you can protect your investment.</p> <p>With only one side pre-printed, these promotional flags have a design that facilitates correct display and makes them conveniently ready to use right out of the box.

Use <strong>Custom Pre-Printed Now Open Feather Flags</strong> outside your building so customers know you are now open for business. The flags help generate buzz for your business from Day One.</p> <p>Our marketing flags come in an appealing combination of navy blue and white that attract attention. A simple “Now Open” message is on the flags, so consumers can easily read from a distance. Possessing 90 GSM high-quality knitted polyester fabric, our pre-printed now open feather flag printings are highly durable and long-lasting.</p> <p>We use 1440 DPI, full color, dye sublimation printing technique to generate high-resolution images. The “Now open” sturdy flags are available for single and double side printing. The single-sided version shows the graphic mirrored on the reverse side with 50 to 60% visibility. Hence, your message is easily seen from the backside as well. If you want to showcase two different images on both sides or the same images, our double-sided printing is a perfect option. For double-sided flags, a stitched liner secures both sides of each flag to keep the fabric in place.</p> <p>These reliable pre-printed feather flags are available in multiple sizes for easy selection. From small to large, all our sizes can easily fit into any space. The available options are 2 ft x 7.58 ft, 2 ft x 9.58 ft, 2.25 ft x 11.5 ft, and 2.5 ft x 15.42 ft. The tough carbon composite fiber glass material is reliable and durable in corrosive environments.</p> <p>Now Open flags have customization options to choose from. There are options available to ship the fabric or the pole by itself. For pole options, you can select either a spike base for grass, a cross base for flat surfaces, or a cross base with a water bag for stability. You can also order the flags in a double-sided version so customers can read the flag from any direction.</p> <p>Bannerbuzz feather flags are simple to install, regardless of which pole option you choose. Spike bases can be easily pushed into dirt or soil to keep the flags stable. Cross bases have their own set of legs and stand on any surface. Water bags just need water for buoyancy so the flags and cross bases can float.</p> <p>The portability of these advertising flags makes them quick to move and relocate. Each version is easy to carry and transfer to a different spot for another opening or re-opening. This re-using provides good value for money.</p> <p>The marketing flags come with the Now open graphics, pre-printed. Simply assemble the pole and fasten the fabric onto it. As opposed to designing your own feather-style flags, owning these flags requires less time and resources.</p> <p>The Now Open signs can be cleaned easily. Machine wash or hand wash the flags with mild liquid detergent for a thorough clean. This removes accumulated grime and dust so customers can see the flag clearly.</p> <p>Shop for Pre-Printed Now Open Feather Flags for your business online at BannerBuzz.

People across the globe come together to celebrate the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities in several ways. People show recognition &amp; support for the LGBT community by holding and raising pride flags &amp; banners at rallies &amp; parades. Offering custom-printed flags &amp; banners for pride celebrations is our way of showing support &amp; inclusiveness. Our <strong>custom pride flags</strong> come in predefined &amp; custom sizes to meet your requirements.</p> <p>The flags are made using 90 GSM knitted polyester fabric for resilience. The pride flag printing is done using 1440 DPI, dye sublimation printing technique in full color. The myriad color combination reproduced using this technique ensures the colors are fade-resistant and leave a lasting impression on onlookers.</p> <p>Our beautifully printed pride flags are a fantastic way to support and promote the gay, lesbian, and transgender community at any indoor or outdoor activity. You can bring our durable &amp; versatile flag banners to use by hanging, hand-holding, or installing them on poles or cars as per your advertising needs. You can select a suitable size from our predefined or custom size options to suit your advertising &amp; installation needs well.</p> <p>Our rainbow pride banners are designed to show support and create awareness of the LGBTQ community. You can encourage inclusiveness and equality by advertising these flags outside your business space or workplace. You can even add a branding touchpoint to your pride flags with our custom design feature by uploading your artwork or using our easy design tool. We also offer the option to hire a designer for intricate design purposes.</p> <p>To help you promote what you believe in, we leave it to you to add the right messaging to your rainbow pride flag. Get creative and add a voice to your LGBTQ flag via a custom-printed message, slogan, or symbol.</p> <p>We offer both single-sided &amp; double-sided printing choices to accommodate your pride flag promotion needs. The single-sided flag is printed on one side, with 50%-60% visibility of the mirrored image on the backside. Even though the design is somewhat visible on the other side, you should only use a one-sided flag for one-way advertising.</p> <p>The essential benefit of a double-sided flag is having the same or separate images printed on each side of the flag. These flags have a liner sewn between the two sides so that the reflection of one print does not overlap with the print on the other side. Our 2-sided pride flag provides maximum coverage as it communicates the message clearly from both sides and does not limit your ability to advertise.</p> <p>Our pride flags come with two different finishing options. Both our quality finishing options add a clean &amp; professional look to the flag banner. One of the options is our heavy-duty metal grommets which are perfect for a variety of installation needs. Heavy-duty brass grommets are placed onto punched holes, creating a secure &amp; strong edge across the top or left side of the flag based on your preferred selection.</p> <p>The other finishing option is the pole pocket, preferably used for installing the flag graphic over a pole or cable. To create the pole pocket (top or left), we fold and seal the flag material towards the back. The strong pocket sleeve allows the pole or rod to slide into it easily.
